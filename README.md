# BashShell

Created a mini shell for linux. It can carry out basic commands like echo, cat, cd, mkdir, rmdir, etc (5 internal + 5 external commands with 2 options for each command). The shell is written in C using system calls to execute the commands.

Note that you may need to change some hard-coded paths in source code for some commands to work.
